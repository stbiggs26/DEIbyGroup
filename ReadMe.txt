1. Project Title (5pts)
2. Team (Names)
3. Project Description (80pts)
* Objectives 10pts: State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you solve and etc?
o Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are three words extremely significant to most spaces in the United States right now, particularly in places of employment. I work in Human Resources at a University where we have several programs dedicated to DEI work, and our staff employees are required to take these course(s) based on whether or not they manage people. However, for the sake of this analysis and anonymity, I will not be revealing the exact names of our coursework nor will I be revealing the name of my employer.
o The objective of my analysis and application will be to allow users to answer the question of whether or not these programs are bearing a positive, significant impact. The application will allow users to view efficacy by department at the University.
* Usefulness 10pts: State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar or equivalent applications out here?  If so, what are they and how is yours different? Which user group/stakeholders is your application targeting?
o We have ways of tracking who has taken different HR coursework through Tableau, but we have not yet used data to question our working theory that this coursework is making a “difference,” that it is actually a good resource to offer. We also have survey data taken directly after individuals take the coursework, but we aren’t tracking whether or not the lessons learned are really sticking with people and if they’re using those lessons in their actual daily work and interactions with others.
o I am not familiar with similar tools at other Universities. Data-driven DEI, from benchmarking that we’ve done, is rather a burgeoning subject. In fact in HR, data analytics is one of the most important skills professionals can be learning as the field moves more towards data-driven decision-making.
o My application has several stakeholders and potential users:
* Not only is the Vice President of HR interested in this question, so is our Board of Trustees and the Executive Vice President of the University. The Director of Diversity and Inclusion oversees these programs, and it is a question he’s been tasked with to identify whether or not the courses he oversees are bearing an impact and if changes need to be made. 
* This is also of interest for almost every Vice President and Dean at the University, who are all hoping to diversify their programs scholastically and create a more inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. We have programs that we require of the folks who work at the University (staff are required, and faculty may attend though aren’t required).
* Every staff member is required to take this coursework, so it’s worthwhile to figure out if this will be worth their time or if they should be spending their time elsewhere.
* Finally, the goal of this coursework is to create a more inclusive, kind culture, wherein equity is pushed and diverse voices are encouraged and given space. Therefore, you could make the argument that the final goal of this coursework is not just meant to impact the staff who take it, but everyone with whom they interact on campus (and hopefully take some of the lessons learned off campus as well).
* The users of this application would be leadership (Executive Officers, VP’s, and Deans) and groups in HR interested in workplace culture (my team).
* Dataset 30pts: 
o Describe dataset origin (who collected, when, and for what purpose)
* What/Why: I will be working with two data sets: one demonstrating who has attended our DEI program(s). There are two programs, one for management and one for individual contributors (non-management staff). I will refer to these two programs, henceforth, as the M and IC programs, respectively. However, for the purposes of much of this analysis, I will consider them one DEI program data set. The second data set will be the most recent results of our University-wide survey, which looks at favorability in certain parts of the questions and has a “Respect and Fairness” index that we utilize as a more cultural measure (more DEI-focused) in the different areas on campus.
* Who collects: HR’s learning group collects the DEI program data through our learning and performance tool/vendor. Employees sign up for coursework through this tool, and then the learning team notes if they actually attend (1. to be sure all employees are attending this required class and 2. to track how popular the coursework is and be sure that if you signed up, you actually attended). This data is stored in that system and can be exported via a spreadsheet and/or uploaded into Tableau directly. HR holds a culture survey every two years. It is campus-wide, and we use a survey tool through an external vendor. This vendor stores the raw data and uploads it into a user-friendly application that leadership on campus can use to assess areas of improvement for our different groups on campus.
* When collected: The DEI program data is collected in real time as people sign up and finish coursework. We offer this coursework on a biweekly basis. In fact, they will be offering a DEI program on Wednesday, October 12, 2022. The survey data was collected in March of 2022 and available for leadership to review in May 2022. 
o Provide initial data summary (e.g. #records, #fields, #NA values, does it require any cleaning)
* DEI program data:
* The fields are “department,” “current headcount,” and “percent attended.” This only looks at the percent of current employees who have attended the DEI programs.
* There will be no NA values here.
* This data set does not require any cleanup.
* Survey data:
* The variables here would be department, overall favorability score, completion rate, and respect and fairness index score.
* No NA values here.
* This data set won’t require any cleanup.
*  Functionalities 20pts:  Describe tentatively what tasks your application will perform. There are two types of functions you would need to offer:
* Data Science Functions: I am planning for this application to offer (at least) frequency visualization for each data set, some descriptive statistics, testing my hypothesis that departments with higher rates of DEI program attendance also experience higher favorability scores from the survey. I also tentatively plan to perform a regression analysis and test for significance (of the residuals). Ideally, if the class is making the impact we’d want,  we should see a positive linear relationship here.
* User interaction: The user will be able to search and filter by department on campus. They will also be able to filter by favorability scores as well. 
o Note - your application should be focused on Applied Data Science methods (ML/DL)
* Communication and Sharing 10pts: Set up your own preferred communication methods (zoom, teams, discord ...) and provide a github repository link for the project:
o create a Read.me file with the initial project description
o upload dataset
4. Personal Contribution Statement (10pts)
* individual project: Reflect on how you will manage time/tasks to complete milestones
Writing (5pts)
* Make sure it is free from spelling mistakes - consider it as your development proposal for your company
* Format your submission according to graduate school standard: APA style.
